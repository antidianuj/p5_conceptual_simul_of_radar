This repo contains conceptual visualization of how Radar can be used to measure vital signs.

Following shows how the heart and lungs contracy and relax independently to form an overall fourier series.

Following shows how a Radar board can be used to intercept this Fourier series.

Following shows how curvature of a signal effects the Fourier series as the distribution of sizes of the circle that correspond to Fouier series.

Following shows how the frequency spectrum changes as the frequency of the signal changes. So, it can be observed that as the frequency suddenly changes, the spectrum expands, and then contracts. Quite interesting.
